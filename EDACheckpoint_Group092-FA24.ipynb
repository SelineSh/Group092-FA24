    "In recent years, heightened concerns over climate change and air pollution have drawn significant attention to sustainable transportation. Electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid vehicles are gaining traction across the United States, particularly in eco-conscious states like Washington. These vehicles are essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and lowering dependency on fossil fuels. Additionally, rising fuel prices are prompting more consumers to consider electric or fuel-efficient hybrid options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although both governments and businesses actively promote the electric vehicle market, consumer preferences vary considerably by region, especially in the choice between hybrid vehicles and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Understanding these regional preferences offers valuable insights for assessing market demand and shaping policies that support a smoother transition toward electrification in the transportation sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior studies indicate that preferences for EVs and hybrids differ across geographic regions. In a study by Nelder and Jung (2016)<a name=\"cite_ref-1.1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1.1), factors influencing the adoption of EVs were examined, including the distribution of charging infrastructure, vehicle range, and geographic characteristics. These factors significantly impact the efficiency of both hybrid and electric vehicles, influencing consumer preferences for each type across different areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another relevant study by Morrissey et al. (2016)<a name=\"cite_ref-1.2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-1.2) analyzed EV adoption patterns in several European countries, focusing on urban versus rural regions. They found that urban consumers were more inclined to choose BEVs due to readily available charging infrastructure, whereas rural areas favored hybrids, given their flexibility in regions with limited charging options. This research supports the notion that consumer preferences for hybrids and BEVs may vary based on infrastructure and geography, aligning closely with our research question of whether statistically significant preference differences exist across Washington counties.\n",

The preference will be measure by the ratio of BEV and plug-in vehicle across the counties. We believe that people perfer BEVs more because the price of BEVs is lower than hybrid vehicles and consumers do not need to be concerned with the fluctuating price of gasoline."

    "The dataset includes all electric car registered across the counties in Washington state, and the model year of the EVs varied from 1999 to 2025. It has 210162 rows of observations as the population, and we could sample randomly from the dataset if needed. The dataset allows us to conduct for statistical analysis since the samples would be over 1000 observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the variables are categorical variables, stored as string, such as County, City, Model Year, Make, and Electric Vehicle Type. There are only two quantitative variables stored as float, which is Electric Range and Base MSRP. Electric Range describes the distance that EV can travel on a single charge of its battery, while Base MSRP describes the manufacturer price of a EV without any additional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important variables of the dataset for our project are County and Electric Vehicle Type. The County column includes the county of the EV is registered in, and the Electric Vehicle Type identifies the vehicle as Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) or Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV). ANother variable that we might dive into would be Base MSRP since we think there would be more BEVs due to the cheaper price.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare for the analysis, we could store the dataset as a Pandas dataframe, drop uncessary features to lessen computational burden, check missing values, and ensure correct data types for features. We would also group by the EV by counties to gain insight on the percent ratio of BEVs and PHEVs across the counties."
